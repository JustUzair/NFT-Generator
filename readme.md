# NFT-Generator

I took the inspiration from [Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meTpMP0J5E8) and thought of making a full fledged web app that allowed for artists to upload and generate their arts, and allowed for users to buy them/mint them.

The project is supposed to be a crossover between Web2 and Web3, where artists can upload their arts and generate unique
NFTs from them.

The logics / features that are implemented on top of [Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meTpMP0J5E8)'s exisitng one are:

- Dynamically calculated the no. of layers that are uploaded by the artists, based on them generated the arts.

- Storing the data about generated arts in database

- Allow artists to upload their arts through the form given on frontend.

- Refactored Fireship.io's synchronous art generation logic to asynchronous (non-blocking), so that the server can continue to handle the requests, while generating the arts.

- Sign Up user according to their preferred roles

- Send welcome emails to newly created users.

- Hashing User's password as a security measure before storing it into the database.

- Login functionality implemented from scratch using JWT.

- Restricting users from performing un-authorized actions, for example:

  - Allow only artists to upload and generate arts
  - Allow only admin(s) to view all the users of the system
  - All the user can update their own data, but only can admin(s) can update other user's data including their own.

- Reset password and forgot functionality by sending the password reset link over to the Users's email.

- Uploading and Resizing User's PFPs.

- All the views of the above functionalities are implemented as views using Pug template engine (SSR - Server Side Rendering).

- Global Error Handling, both on server as well as the client side.
